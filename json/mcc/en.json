      "description": "MCC is a four-digit code that helps determine the type of business of an entrepreneur (their product or service) during bank card transactions to clarify the purchase category, as well as the cashback percentage. For example, you have selected a product in a pharmacy and paid with a bank card. Thanks to the MCC code, the bank will understand where the purchase was made and will award increased bonuses if you had previously selected 'Pharmacies' as the increased cashback category"
