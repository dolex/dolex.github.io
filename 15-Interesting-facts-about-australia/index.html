  <img class="kangaroos" src="kangaroos.png" title="kangaroos" alt="kangaroos">

  <h2>1. The <span data-tooltip="/ˈav(ə)rij/ - средний">Average</span> <span data-tooltip="/ˈɒzi,ˈɒsi/ - австралиец">Aussie</span> drinks 96 liters of beer per year</h2>
  
  <p>In addition to Goon (the iconic cask wine), the Aussies also enjoy having a beer or two. On average they drink 96 liters of beer per year!</p>

  <h2>2. Highway 1 is the longest national highway in the world</h2>

  <p>It’s about 14 500 kilometers and <span data-tooltip="/səːkəmnavɪˈɡeɪʃ(ə)n/ - плавать вокруг">circumnavigates</span> the country. Now that’s one epic road trip!</p>

  <h2>3. There are more kangaroos than people</h2>

  <p>Some data reports that the total population of Kangaroos is almost 50 million now. Back in 2016, there were almost 45 million Kangaroos, which means that there are more Kangaroos in Australia than people!</p>

  <h2>4. The Drop Bear was created to <span data-tooltip="/ske(ə)r/ - пугать, попугать">scare</span> tourists</h2>

  <p>The Drop Bear is an imaginary animal that’s supposed to be a <span data-tooltip="/ˈpredəˌtôrē/ - хищный">predatory</span> version of the Koala. It was created by the Aussies to scare away tourists! But you can rest assure, the drop bear will not jump down from the trees and attack you.</p>

  <h2>5. Australia has the second-highest human development index</h2>

  <p>One thing the Aussies can <span data-tooltip="/prīd/ - гордость, гордиться">pride</span> <span data-tooltip="/T͟Hem-,T͟Həmˈselvz/ - самих себя, сами, себя, сами">themselves</span> is the fact that they’re ranking high in the human development index. This index measures various things such as equality, <span data-tooltip="/ˈlʌɪfspan/ - продолжительность жизни, срок жизни">lifespan</span>, <span data-tooltip="/ˈwelˌfe(ə)r/ - благосостояние">welfare</span> etc. Australia comes in at second place, just after Norway.</p>

  <h2>6. And they love Vegemite</h2>

  <p>What is vegemite you might ask? It’s one of those Australian foods that you have to try at least once in your life. Vegemite is a <span data-tooltip="/THik/ - толстый, густой">thick</span> spread made from leftover brewers’ yeast extract with various vegetable and spice additives.</p>

  <p>The Aussies usually put the spread on sandwiches, toast, crumpets and cracker biscuits as well as a <span data-tooltip="/ˈfiliNG/ - заполнение, наполнение">filling</span> for <span data-tooltip="/ˈpeɪstri/+s - выпечка">pastries</span>.</p>

  <h2>7. Melbourne has the largest Greek population outside of Greece</h2>

  <p>This is quite an interesting fact about Australia, especially for greeks. In Melbourne, there are an <span data-tooltip="/ˈɛstɪmeɪtɪd/ - по оценкам (предполагаемый)">estimated</span> 162 000 people that claim Greek ancestry.</p>

  <h2>8. There’s a mountain named “Mt. Disappointment”</h2>

  <p>An 800-meter high mountain that was named by the explorers Hamilton Hume and William Hovell in 1824. The mountain got its name because of the <span data-tooltip="/ˌdisəˈpointiNG/ - разочарование, неутешительный">disappointing</span> view from the top. The explorers expected to see Port Philipp Bay from the top, but a large number of trees <span data-tooltip="/priˈvent/+it - предотвращено">prevented</span> this.</p>

  <h2>9. Australia’s dingo fence is longer than the Great Wall of China</h2>

  <p>The Great Wall of China is famous around the world, and it’s truly <span data-tooltip="/spekˈtakyələr/ - захватывающий">spectacular</span>, but did you know that Australia’s dingo <span data-tooltip="/fens/ - забор">fence</span> is actually longer? The national dingo fence <span data-tooltip="/ˈmeZHərs/ - меры, измерять">measures</span> 5600 kilometers.</p>

  <h2>10. Some of the world’s deadliest animals live here</h2>

  <p>Yes, Australia is home to the <span data-tooltip="/ˈdedlē/ - смертоносный, смертельный
	
   ">deadliest</span> spider, the deadliest snake, the deadliest octopus, the deadliest fish and so on. But despite this, very few people are actually killed by these highly <span data-tooltip="/ˈvenəməs/ - ядовитый">venomous</span> animals. From the year 2000 and 2013, more people were even killed by horses than Australia’s deadliest animals combined.</p>

  <h2>11. Australia was <span data-tooltip="/inˈhabit/+t -обитаемый [ населяют ]">inhabited</span> for at least 50 000 years before the British came</h2>

  <p>The <span data-tooltip="/ˌabəˈrijənl/ - абориген, аборигенный">Aboriginal</span> people have lived in Australia for at least 50 000 years. They’re generally <span data-tooltip="/kənˈsɪdəd/ - считается"></span> to have the oldest living culture on Earth.</p>

  <h2>12. Australia has over 10 000 beaches</h2>

  <p>If you visited one beach a day, it would take about 27 years to explore 10 000 beaches. No wonder that surfing and other water and beach activities are so popular!</p>

  <h2>13. It’s the 6<sup>th</sup> largest country in the world</h2>

  <p>Some people don’t think of the land down under as one of the <span data-tooltip="/lärj/+est - крупнейший">largest</span> countries in the world, but the total area is a massive 2.9 million square miles or 7 692 000 km². That’s just slightly smaller than the continental U.S.</p
   >
  <p>However, Australia is one of the least densely populated countries with only 3 people per square kilometer.</p>

  <h2>14. The Australian Alps <span data-tooltip="/riˈsēv/ - получать">receive</span> more snow than Switzerland</h2>

  <p>Probably one of the more surprising facts about Australia. Because it’s one of the aridest countries in the world and is generally known for the sun and heat. But the Australian Alps are bigger than Switzerland, so it’s not that surprising after all.</p>

  <p>The Australian Alps are part of the Great Dividing Range, the series of mountains, hills, and highlands that runs about 3,000 kilometers (1,900 mi) from northern Queensland, through New South Wales, and into the northern part of Victoria.</p>

  <h2>15. Home to the largest living structure on Earth – The Great Barrier Reef</h2>

  <p>While some scientists declared the Great Barrier Reef dead back in 2016, the world’s largest coral reef is still alive, even <span data-tooltip="/T͟Hō/ - хоть {союз} | однако {наречие}">though</span> it needs to be protected from pollution and other problems that the world’s oceans are facing.</p>

  <p>Another cool fact is that the Great Barrier Reef is so large that it’s visible from space!</p>
